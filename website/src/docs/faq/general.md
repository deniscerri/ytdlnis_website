Frequently Asked Questions

## Why isn't YTDLnis on the Google Play Store?
**YTDLnis** won't be on the **Google Play Store**.

yt-dlp and similar tools conflict with [Google Play's content policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/).
**Google** might take down the app due to certain content, which the developers wishes to avoid.

## Is YTDLnis available for iOS/iPadOS?
There is no iOS or iPadOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps. Also there isn't a library that implements yt-dlp for IOS.
You might look into [SW-DLT](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/) which is a basic tool for downloading in IOS.

Any app proclaiming to be "**YTDLnis for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## Can I download from Netflix / Amazon Prime etc?
Nope, and I mean yt-dlp won't support that. This is because Spotify is one of many services that is DRM protected, and DRM bypassing attempt is **illegal**. Not only Spotify, many platforms also do this. Which means, you'd need to find the other way to download from these DRM protected platforms.

## Can I watch YouTube from the app?
**YTDLnis** isn't designed for video streaming, but for downloading video/audio streams.

## Where should I report issues or suggest features?
The most preferred method is to report from GitHub, but before reporting anything, take a look at the [existing ones](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis/issues?q=is%3Aissue) first, one (or more) of them might be similar to what's on your mind. And therefore, we want to prevent duplicate issues. If you're sure that you understand and want to proceed, follow this [link](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis/issues/new/choose).

The second method is to report in the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/ytdlnis/1). Including `#bug_report`<C/> or `#suggestion tag`<C/> is preferred for easier tracking for the Dev, Maintainer, and Admin.
