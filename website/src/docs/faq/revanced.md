# How the heck do I integrate YTDLnis to ReVanced ⁉️⁉️ RAH 🗣️🗣️🗣️ SCREECH 🦅🦅🦅
It's easy.

Revanced settings differ between many patch organizations. You need to find the external downloader settings and input the app's package name:

`com.deniscerri.ytdl`

Then simply press the download icon in the video player and start downloading! :P
