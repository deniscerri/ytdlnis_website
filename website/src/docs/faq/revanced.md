# How the heck do I integrate YTDLnis to ReVanced or LibreTube ⁉️⁉️ RAH 🗣️🗣️🗣️ SCREECH 🦅🦅🦅
It's easy.

Revanced settings differ between many patch organizations. You need to find the external downloader settings and input the app's package name:

Go to LibreTube settings. Paste the YTDLnis package name into the 'External download provider' section in the Advanced section. 

Package name: `com.deniscerri.ytdl`

Then simply press the download icon in the video player and start downloading! :P
