## Scheduled

Each download where you have configured a scheduled time will be here. You can choose to download them immediately if you want, or even do this in bulk.

## Cancelled

## Errored

All items that failed to download will be here. You can easily press the file icon and it will send you to the log file showing you the whole download process and the error that caused it to fail.
