Frequently Asked Question about the Home Screen.

## How do I download multiple items at the same time?
Tap and hold a card and then you can press the rest of the cards. The context bar will show up on top where you can download all selected items, or delete them.
You can also select two cards and then tap the option to select all items between them, or invert selections or select everything.

## I have many urls that i need to download
You can copy them in your clipboard and the app will show you the clipboard floating action button. If there are more than 1, the app will open the search page and list out all the urls. You can then remove them and press the search icon to start querying them.

## I have configured the app to not show the download card but i want it to open up sometimes
You can press and hold the video/audio button in a result item and the download card will open.

## I want to have video recommendations in the home screen
Go to <nav to="recommnedations"> and select the video recommendation method.

## How do I manage what's downloading?
Navigate to <nav to="download-queue"> to interact with queued downloads or double tab the downloads icon in the navigation bar.

Cancel all items by clicking the **Overflow** button beside a series chapter or the top right corner.

To reorder the queue, long-press and drag the `=` icon next to a queue item.
