About PoToken

PoToken is a token system created by YouTube to validate stream requests. Each Client works with a different PoToken. Only Web Client PoTokens are compatible. For now, we are getting PoTokens for web clients. In the future, there will be more.

Using PoToken in YTDLnis

This is easy now. There are two options: (PoToken + Visitordata OR PoToken + visitordata + Cookies)

1. Go to Settings/Advanced. 
2. Then, click on the "Generate to PoToken" section. 
3. Enable the "Web Client PoToken" option. 
4. Click the ReGenerate button. 
5. Then, depending on your preference, log in to your YT account (recommended) or not. 
6. Then click "ok". 
7. If you have enabled the "Visitordata" option below, to use "PoToken+visitor data" with cookies, log in to your YouTube account in "cookies" and click "Get DATA Sync ID" and copy and paste it into the "Data Sync ID" section.

PoToken validity period

We don't know. It doesn't update automatically. If you don't want to, update it every day.ðŸ˜Š
