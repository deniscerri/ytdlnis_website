# Observe Sources
How to setup Observe Sources in YTDLnis.

Observe Sources are a way of making the app periodically check for changes in a source like a playlist or channel and download newly uploaded videos from it.

- You can configure a set schedule based on hours, days, days of week or monthly.
- How often to check
- Stop after a certain number of checks

The download configuration shares the same settings as your normal download. Learn more [here.](/docs/guides/download-card)

## Settings

`Get New Uploads Only`

When activated, the first run won't download anything. It will record all the available items and store them as processed, so next time they will be ignored

`Sync With Source`

If the source has deleted an item from the playlist / channel, the app will delete it from your download history as well, along with the file

`Retry Missing Downloads`

This checks your download history. If you have had deleted an item from the history, the app will try to download it again so both your history and the source are synced.
