# Terminal
How to use Terminal.

::: tip Note
This is not an actual terminal emulator, but a simple text based interface where you can execute yt-dlp commands
:::

Pretty much write down your yt-dlp command and hit `Run Command`

## Options

You can access your created command templates and shortcuts to build your command.

The folder icon lets you choose the preferred destination where to download and it will write down the download path.

You can modify the text size and export the output to your clipboard.

## Terminal in Share Menu

In General Settings enable this option to have the terminal as an option in the share menu when sharing an url. The URL will be automatically written in it.
