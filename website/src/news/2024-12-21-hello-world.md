# Official Website

Following many complains and issues of false websites that profit off of this FOSS application,
i have built this ad-free website.

You can find here all the guides about how to use the application and frequently asked questions.
The site has a [changelogs](/changelogs/) page where you can easily see historical app release notes.

This page is part of the new [news](/news/) section, which will be used in occasions
like this to keep you informed of any interesting updates, but most of the updates will be in the [guide](/docs/guides/getting-started) section.

This website is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and its influenced by the Tachiyomi website design.

If you find any errors or outdated information on a guide, please report by opening an issue in the [repository for this website](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis_website/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
