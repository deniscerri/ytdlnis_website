# YT-DLP

**YTDLnis** is a Graphical User Interface of the popular cli downloader tool [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), for Android devices.
YT-DLP is a powerful tool but it can be daunting to an average user that is not used to terminal commands.

YTDLnis has implemented the majority of the features found in yt-dlp using an easy to use interface. And the ones that haven't been implemented still can be applied in the app through the use of [Extra Commands](/docs/guides/extra-commands) or the internal [Terminal](/docs/guides/terminal) screen that emulates yt-dlp commands.

If you encounter any issues with the download process, most likely you are having issues with yt-dlp and not the app itself. Please raise those issues to yt-dlp and hopefully they will fix them!
